## Running application

The only precondition is Ruby 2.3 installed and `ruby` command should be available in PATH.

Ensure that `canvas.sh` is executable and enter in command line:

`./canvas.sh`

## Running tests

Install rspec using `gem install rspec`. RSpec library is used to simplify writing and running tests. RSpec along with Minitest is one of the most used test libraries in ruby world.

Run all specs using command `rspec` from the current folder.

## Limitations

The application is expected to be run in a terminal shell. Width and height of the canvas are limited by shell size.
